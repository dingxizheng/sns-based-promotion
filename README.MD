# SNS-Based Promotion
 
In addition to traditional ways of getting and browsing interested information, this project did research and experiences on bringing users a new way of getting informed when new promotions come to the database. With pre-defined custom tags or other conditionsï¼Œ promotions will be pushed to users through their own channels. With all these new ideas, a goal was made to this project which is to design and implement a social network and location-based deals promotion system. A place where local business owners can post their latest deals to the local subscribers.
